Overview
*********

SpAlgo is a python library with special algorithms which can help you in your education or any other purpose.
By now, this library contains some algorithms for the following items and other algorithms will be added soon.
  - Subsequence
  - Array
  - Matrix

life is so short so you don't need to spend your time implementing these algorithms so we recommend you use SpAlgo if you want to have a faster experience.

Usage
*******

In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use Scrapeasy for your own projects.

-----------
Getting it
-----------

To download SpAlgo, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.


.. code-block::

    $ pip install SpAlgo


---------
Using it
---------

SpAlgo was programmed with ease-of-use in mind. First, import Matrix, Array and Subsequence from SpAlgo.

for more exact usage documents you can see the `example <https://github.com/Amir-Shamsi/SpAlgo/tree/master/src/examples>`_ folder


.. code-block:: python

    from SpAlgo import Matrix, Array, MaxSubseq, Knapsack, ClosestPair, Point



then you can them bassed on what you need.

for ``array`` the current available methods are:

.. code-block:: python

    findPeak()
    findAllPeak()
    findFisrtPeak()
    findMaxPeak()
    findMaxPeak()

for ``matrix`` the current available methods are:

.. code-block:: python

    findPeak()
    findAllPeak()

for ``subsequence`` the current available methods are:

.. code-block:: python

    maximmum_sum()
    subsequence()

for ``Knapsack`` the current available methods are:

.. code-block:: python

    getPack()
    getTotalValue()
    getUsedWeight()
    getWastedWeight()
    getCrumbledItem()
    
for ``ClosestPair`` the current available methods are:

.. code-block:: python

    get_min_distance()
    get_closest_pair()
